              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Hijab, in Islamic tradition, refers to the principle of modesty
                and privacy. It is commonly understood as the practice of Muslim
                women wearing clothing that covers their hair, neck, and often
                their face, in the presence of non-related adult males.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                In Islam, hijab is seen as a symbol of modesty, privacy, and
                dignity. It serves to protect women from unwanted attention and
                promotes a sense of inner beauty and self-respect. Additionally,
                hijab is considered a form of obedience to the commandments of God
                (Allah) and a means of identifying oneself as a practicing Muslim.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Quran, the holy book of Islam, contains several verses that
                encourage modesty and prescribe the wearing of hijab for Muslim
                women. For example, in Surah An-Nur (24:31), Allah instructs women
                to draw their veils over their bosoms and not to display their
                beauty except to certain relatives.
